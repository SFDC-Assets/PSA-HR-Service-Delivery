        <questionText>All applicationsfor funding &lt;b&gt;require you&lt;/b&gt; to complete a self-identification form; however, if you would
prefer not to self-identify and/or provide the requested information, you may select â€œI prefer not to
answer&quot; for any or all of the questions. Canada Research Chairs Program nominees must complete a
self-identification form as an application requirement. Where the nominating institution has not met
its equity targets, the program restricts nominationsto nominees who have self-identified as a
member of one or more of the four designated groups (women, persons with disabilities, Indigenous
peoples and members of visible minorities). Where the nominating institution has met its equity
targets, there are no such restrictions.</questionText>
