        <questionText>The Tri-agency Institutional Programs Secretariat (TIPS) also shares aggregated self-identification data
with host institutions to allow them to monitor their efforts in meeting their equity targets for the
Canada Research Chairs Program. While TIPS never sharesself-identification data specific to an
individual, it is possible that some institutions may be able to identify some individuals&apos; personal
information when the aggregated data shared isfor fewer than five chairholders. TIPS shares data
with only one key administrative contact per institution, identified by the institution as having the
authority to receive the data, under very strict confidentiality requirements. No data on sexual
orientation nor the subcategories of visible minority group and persons with disabilities is shared with
institutions.</questionText>
